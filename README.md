# homebrew-tap

The bearcove tap, where [homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulas are stored :)

> **Warning**
> There are no formulas available as of Apr 22, 2025. They'll be coming soon as I'm still in the process of migrating from forgejo.

Then install a formula:

```bash
brew install bearcove/tap/home
```

## Uninstall
